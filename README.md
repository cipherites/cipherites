## HI this is for PONY TOWN

I'm gonna put this up here...ok?

NO taking inspirations from my ponies. Copying is also prohibited.

I'm Hachi! PLEASE whisper to int, since im often offtab, especially when im alone.

I'm always welcome for new people, don't be shy to int! Please ASK for me to add you, since my adds are off! But before you ask, please make sure we already got to know eachother

Stated in strawpage, english is NOT my mother language, I might do grammar mistakes!

C + H are ALWAYS welcome!

I'm in LOTS of fandom! I don't list all of them in my strawpage. If you're curious, you can always ask about it!
Ex: Do you watch Puella Magi Madoka Magica?

SHIPS are okay to int. I don't mind at all, as long as you keep it respectful.
(Respectful as in respecting the character's CANON sexuality. I don't tolerate lesbians x men, or gays x women. Also minor x adult & incest dni, ok...?)

I don't roleplay. Or more likely because I'm bad at it, ok? ok

I do not ship any ship beside the ones I mentioned in my strawpage (FunnyBunny, VoxVal, BillFord), unless I have told you that I like a certain ship. But you can always ask what else do I like.
Ex : Do you like HisoIllu?

Basic DNI criteria, don't be weird around me or/and my friends, especially when we just met. Please be respectful, your actions might make me or/and my friends uncomfortable.

DO NOT INT me if one (or more) of the fandoms, characters, and ships I listed in my strawpage is in your dni list or something you do not like/enjoy, unless you're fine with people liking them. But seriously though, do not int if you don't like it
